This repository is about Expense Tracker application in React JavaScript library. This application has the ability to store and display income and expenses by using 
positive (+) and negative (-) signs respectively. It uses those transactions to calculate user's balance. This React web application is based YouTube video called 
"Build an Expense Tracker | React Hooks & Context API" and it's URL is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ . I watched and studied this video as part of 
becoming competent ReactJS web developer. 

Users can delete transactions in their history if they made an error.

**What I learnt while making this application above:** I learnt many things while making this application such as how tomake many JavaScript pages join together
in order to make this application run seamlessly. I learnt how to make for adding and deleting transactions. 

**How might I improve:** Making more comments aroud the code to show my understanding. Redeploy this React web application again from my 
Visual Studios Code software so that all of my code can be seen by public.
